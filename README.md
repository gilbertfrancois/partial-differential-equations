# Numerical methods for Partial Differential Equations with Python

_Gilbert Fran√ßois Duivesteijn_



## About

This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, containing methods for solving different types of PDEs, using Numpy and SciPy. Most notebooks take a special case of the general convection-diffusion equation

and use a specific method to solve it using a most suitable numerical method. With time, more and more notebooks will be added.
